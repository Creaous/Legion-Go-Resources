# Lenovo Legion Go Resources
A repository containing useful resources for the Lenovo Legion Go.

## Information
I'll be updating this section with the latest information on the Legion Go, as well as any important notices I find. Once the information becomes outdated, it'll be moved to a seperate markdown file for archival purposes.

### Latest
- The embargo lift date is speculated to be the 24th of October according to a reviewer.
- Australian and Singapore pre-orders have been opened up on the official Lenovo site.
- The Z1 (non-extreme), 256gb model is now available on the Australian Lenovo site.

## Tips
- Try to buy the Legion Go on a sale or using a discount code.
- Create a new Lenovo account to receive a 10% discount code.
- Use tools to debloat Windows (see below for more information).
- You should be able to use 2230 SSD with an 2242 adapter on.

## Upgrading the SSD
Ensure that the SSD that you purchase is a 2242, if not then you'll have to use an adapter from 2230 to 2242. The SSD must be NVMe and not a SATA one, it is suggested to make sure the SSD is PCIe 4.0.
