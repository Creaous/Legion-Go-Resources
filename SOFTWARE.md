## Legion Space

Lenovo serves the download for Legion Space on the [drivers list](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/legion-series/legion-go-8apu1/downloads/driver-list/component?name=Software+and+Utilities&id=156BE23F-B536-4320-B35C-2F67EBDD9242), however, it is most likely out of date.
