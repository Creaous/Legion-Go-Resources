# Upgrading the SSD
Ensure that the SSD that you purchase is a 2242, if not then you'll have to use an adapter from 2230 to 2242. The SSD must be NVMe and not a SATA one, it is suggested to make sure the SSD is PCIe 4.0 for best performance.

**DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE A 2280, IT IS TOO BIG FOR THE LEGION GO**
<br/>
*(as someone on the subreddit pointed out, it is possible to install a 2280, however, it is highly discouraged due to the risks (overheating).)*

## Instructions
