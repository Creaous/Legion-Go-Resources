# Getting Started
So you just got your brand new Lenovo Legion Go. Here is a guide on what you should do to get the most out of your new device!

## Debloating
While the Legion Go doesn't come with any bloatware (other than the McAfee option in the setup), Windows still has a ton of bloatware you might not want.

### Chris Titus Tech's Windows Utility
The CTT Debloat tool is very useful, it is also open source and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil).

1. Open Powershell as an Administrator
2. Enter the following command: `irm christitus.com/win | iex`
