# Getting Started
So you just got your brand new Lenovo Legion Go. Here is a guide on what you should do to get the most out of your new device!

## Need more internal storage?
Read more about upgrading the internal SSD [here](GUIDES/UPGRADING-THE-SSD.md).

## Debloating
While the Legion Go doesn't come with any bloatware (other than the McAfee option in the setup), Windows still has a ton of bloatware you might not want.

### Chris Titus Tech's Windows Utility
The CTT Debloat tool is very useful, it is also open source and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil).

1. Open Powershell as an Administrator
2. Enter the following command: `irm christitus.com/win | iex`

## Games not working in fullscreen?
This is a common issue that is happening to many owners, this is due to the screen being portrait. To resolve this issue, some people have suggested to use [Magpie or DxWnd](SOFTWARE.md)

## Updating Drivers *AND/OR* Unlocking AMD Adrenaline
As of the 3rd of November 2023, Lenovo has not provided driver updates for the AMD chipset and is still running an update from July. Because of this, you may encounter problems while trying to start games like Starfield.
