# Linux on the Legion Go
Linux on the Legion Go is a work in progress. Don't expect everything to work.

## Disclaimer
Lenovo provides NO warranty for Linux on the Legion Go. They don't guarantee that Linux will be functional. Using Linux is at your own discretion, as the Legion Go device only *officially* supports Windows.
